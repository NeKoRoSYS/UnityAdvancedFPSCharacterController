# UnityAdvancedFPSCharacterController
An open-source project focusing on creating the best lightweight yet feature-rich non-Rigidbody first person shooter character controller for Unity3D.


## Disclaimer
- There are portions of codes here that I have taken from tutorials. Even though they are free to use I stil want to clarify this.


## Features
- Fully commented
- Mostly uses event-based input (Utilizes Unity's New Input System and InputAction.CallbackContext events)
- Player Audio (Material-based Footsteps and Jump SFX)
- Slope movement
- Smooth crouching
- Movement smoothing
- Camera headbobbing
- Camera Controller smoothing


## Key Notes
- Prefabs are located at Assets\Project\Runtime\Prefabs\
- In order for Player Audio to work, make sure to add the following tags if they aren't already added:
  - Material/Wood
  - Material/Stone
  - Material/Grass
  - Material/Metal
